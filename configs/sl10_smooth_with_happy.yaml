## Reproducing RESULTS.md "Gradient routing experiments" Step 1
## Original: sentence_length_10_smooth_with_happy (0.1 per happy, up to 5, capped at 1.0)
## Decomposed: sl10_smooth (retain, scale=1) + happy_count_max_5 (forget, scale=0.5)
##   -> 0.5 * (count/5) = 0.1 * count, max 0.5; combined capped at 1.0
## RH detector: happy_count, threshold=3 (default from old code; no config override found)
